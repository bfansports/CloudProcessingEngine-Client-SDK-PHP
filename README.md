## What for?

Use this SDK if you want to develop a client application in PHP for the Cloud Processing Engine (CPE) project.

This SDK offers a wrapper around SQS to communicate with the CPE stack and send commands to it. It craft the proper SQS messages for the stack. 

## Usage Example: Client Example

In the CPE project you will find a folder named 'client_example' that uses this SDK to communicate with the stack.

See: https://github.com/sportarchive/CloudProcessingEngine/tree/master/client_example
